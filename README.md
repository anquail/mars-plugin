# atriom-plugin

## Getting Started

### Introduction

The Atriom webpack plugin extracts data from the webpack build process and writes a `.dat` file to a user-specified output path. This plugin is intended for use with applications built with the Webpack 5 `ModuleFederationPlugin`.
The `.dat` file contains the following information:

- name and id of the application
- application dependencies
- development dependencies
- optional dependencies
- application remote
- overrides
- consumed modules
- exposed modules

### Prerequisites

- Webpack version 5.31.0 or higher

### Installation

`npm i atriom-plugin`

## Usage

Add Atriom plugin and configuration to your `webpack.config.js` file.

### Example

`const AtriomPlugin = require('atriom-plugin');`

...

```
plugins: [
    ...
    new DashboardPlugin({
        filename: "ATRIOM",
        outputPath: path.join(\_\_dirname, "../"),
    }),
    ...
]
```

| Key          | Description                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filename`   | Name of the output file\*                               |
| `outputPath` | File path for the .dat file generated by the plugin\*\* |

\*The fileName for each federated application must be identical.

\*\*The outputPath for each federated application must point to the same location.

Once the plugin has been added and configured correctly, simply run your build script:

`yarn workspaces run build`

The Atriom plugin will generate a .dat file at the specified location, which is ready to be used with the Atriom web application:

<linktoAtriom>
